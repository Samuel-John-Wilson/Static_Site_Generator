Create a new function called def markdown_to_html_node(markdown): that converts a full markdown document into a single parent HTMLNode. That one parent HTMLNode should (obviously) contain many child HTMLNode objects representing the nested elements.

FYI: I created an additional 8 helper functions to keep my code neat and easy to understand, because there's a lot of logic necessary for markdown_to_html_node. I don't want to give you my exact functions because I want you to do this from scratch. However, I'll give you the basic order of operations:

Split the markdown into blocks (you already have a function for this)
Loop over each block:
Determine the type of block (you already have a function for this)
Based on the type of block, create a new HTMLNode with the proper data
Assign the proper child HTMLNode objects to the block node. I created a shared text_to_children(text) function that works for all block types. It takes a string of text and returns a list of HTMLNodes that represent the inline markdown using previously created functions (think TextNode -> HTMLNode).
The "code" block is a bit of a special case: it should not do any inline markdown parsing of its children. I didn't use my text_to_children function for this block type, I manually made a TextNode and used text_node_to_html_node.
Make all the block nodes children under a single parent HTML node (which should just be a div) and return it.
